This might seem like a strange comparison to make. But having used Pytest and Mock for many years, I find myself in C++ land learning the Google test framework. In doing so, I'm finding out about just how much freedom Python Mock gives us. Conversely, just how much one really needs to use dependency injection to be able to use Mocks in C++.

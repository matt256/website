You've stumbled upon my personal development blog/ notebook. It's where I attempt to write down how to do things or share opinions. It's goal has a few purposes. 
1. **Quick Reference** To have an archive of things I've figured out. If the explanations are in my own writing I can remember them quicker.
2. **Extended Resume** To prove I know a thing or two. By showing that I've spent the time to learn skills that improve the quality of my products and processes, hopefully future employers/clients will know that this is important to me and I can do it for them too.
3. **Instruct** I value mentor ship as both the mentor and the mentee. I really enjoy when I share some useful knowledge with someone that makes their job better. Likewise, I love learning new things too. I've used blogs a bunch to learn like most people on the internet. Let's give back a bit. That being said, detailed content creation is very time consuming and free time is something I have very little of. The posts may be somewhat abbreviated and without frills. 


# About Me

* 12+ years experience in everything from data analytics, physics simulation development, web frontend, backend, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and AWS.
* Primary skillset is Python with a decent background in JS. I'm okay at C++ but like... is anyone REALLY a master at C++?
* I've spent a lot of time with Django and Flask servers and will hopefully have some good content for these in the future.
* Favorite code editor is VSCode because of course it is.
